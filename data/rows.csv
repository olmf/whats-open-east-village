#173 ((THIS IS A PO BOX))",,,"We are offering a residential compost pickup service.  Our pickup service is a paid service, we can pick up compost weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, from Manhattan residents anywhere south of 87th street. 

We cannot re-open the free compost drop off that was stationed outside 415 E 11th St at our community garden until the City loosens the stay at home order, but we WILL reopen that as a donation-optional drop off in the future. We understand that not everyone has the capacity to, or wants to, pay for compost services. 

All the info can be found on our website: [reclaimedorganics.org/residents][1]
