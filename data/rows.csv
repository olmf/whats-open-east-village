Restaurants generally fall under two categories: 'Full Service Restaurants' and 'Limited Service Restaurants.' A full service restaurant is one where customers are seated at a table, place their orders with a server, and have their food delivered to them. A limited service restaurant, on the other hand, is one where customers order and pay at a counter and might receive minimal table service. Since the specific service style of The Nook is not provided, it cannot be definitively placed into either full service or limited service categories. However, given the usual sit-down nature of Korean restaurants that might include table grilling or specific dining experiences, it is more likely to be a full service restaurant. Therefore, I placed it in 'Full Service Restaurants,' assuming a typical dining setup.",,,,"recWJYTYzm1RWspxF","This U.S. industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing food services to patrons who order and are served while seated (i.e., waiter/waitress service) and pay after eating.
