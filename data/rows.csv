Korean restaurants are usually full-service establishments, where customers come to dine in and are served various dishes, often involving shared meals and unique dining experiences such as Korean BBQ, bibimbap, and other staple foods of Korean cuisine. Therefore, the most appropriate category for Boka is 'Full Service Restaurants'.",,"This U.S. industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing food services to patrons who order and are served while seated (i.e., waiter/waitress service) and pay after eating.

In the given categories, there are two relevant options for restaurants: 'Full Service Restaurants' and 'Limited Service Restaurants'. Since the description doesn't specify whether it's full service (sit-down with waitstaff) or limited service (fast food or takeout), we infer that a restaurant specializing in a specific type like Chinese is more likely to be full service, as these typically include dine-in services. Therefore, the most appropriate category is 'Full Service Restaurants'.","conf 722511 Full-Service Restaurants","This U.S. industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing food services to patrons who order and are served while seated (i.e., waiter/waitress service) and pay after eating.
