Based on the category list provided, 'Full Service Restaurants' and 'Limited Service Restaurants' are the two potential categories under which a restaurant might fall. Generally, 'Limited Service Restaurants' align with takeout, fast-food, or minimal service dining settings, while 'Full Service Restaurants' typically refer to establishments where customers are seated and served by waitstaff. Without specific details on the service model of 'Medan Pasar', but given the nature of the cuisine (Malaysian) which often involves a more traditional dining experience, it is reasonable to categorize 'Medan Pasar' under 'Full Service Restaurants' as this is often the case for international dining establishments aiming to offer a complete culinary experience.",1040,"{""id"":""usrSSqhKNrK05i823"",""email"":""Director@evccnyc.org"",""name"":""Laura Sewell""}","New York","2024-10-10T03:22:57.000Z","1114","NY","10009","102","E. 7th Street","West | 102 E. 7th Street",1,"This U.S. industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing food services to patrons who order and are served while seated (i.e., waiter/waitress service) and pay after eating.

Among the categories provided, 'Bars & Clubs' could seem applicable due to the 'Bar' aspect and serving drinks, but it seems more complete to categorize it primarily based on its core function as a restaurant. Since it is not a full-service restaurant that emphasizes sit-down meals throughout the day, 'Limited Service Restaurants' aligns best if it focuses on a specific style like seafood specialties and bar-style service. However, generally, 'Full Service Restaurants' encompasses eateries that provide sit-down service with a comprehensive menu and a substantial dining experience, which an 'Oyster House' would.

Hence, without other specific details pointing towards limited service, the business belongs under 'Full Service Restaurants'.",192,"{""id"":""usrSSqhKNrK05i823"",""email"":""Director@evccnyc.org"",""name"":""Laura Sewell""}","New York","2024-10-10T03:22:57.000Z","199","NY","10009","95","Avenue A","95 Avenue A",0,"This U.S. industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing food services to patrons who order and are served while seated (i.e., waiter/waitress service) and pay after eating.
