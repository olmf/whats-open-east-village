Out of the available categories, 'Full Service Restaurants' seems like the most fitting choice to cover a venue that offers dining, which is a key aspect of its identity. 'Coffee Shops & Cafés' could also be a potential fit, but it does not encompass the broader restaurant dining experience that's suggested by a place offering a Japanese menu and sake. Therefore, 'Full Service Restaurants' best represents a place where patrons can experience Japanese cuisine and beverages in a sit-down environment.","conf 722511 Full-Service Restaurants","This U.S. industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing food services to patrons who order and are served while seated (i.e., waiter/waitress service) and pay after eating.

In the context of the provided categories, a restaurant that also functions as a bar fits best under the category 'Full Service Restaurants'. This is because the term 'Full Service Restaurants' typically includes sit-down establishments where food and drinks are served, and since the business also has a bar element, it supports the categorization as a full-service dining venue. Additionally, the category 'Bars & Clubs' could also be applicable, but since the primary type is 'Restaurant', the most suitable category among the options provided is 'Full Service Restaurants'.","conf 722511 Full-Service Restaurants",,,"Accommodation and Food Services","Full Service Restaurants","https://www.instagram.com/augustlauranyc/",,"What's Open Filled",,"Limited-Service? none found",,,,,"(646) 905-5693","https://www.augustlauranyc.com/","No","hello@augustlauranyc.com",,"Yes","5:00 PM","2:00 AM",,,"Yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'Full Service Restaurants' typically offer table service and a broader dining experience.

The list provides two categories related to food services: 'Full Service Restaurants' and 'Limited Service Restaurants'. Since Madame Vo is a restaurant and the distinction between 'full' and 'limited' service isn't explicitly given in the type or subtype information, it's more likely to be a full-service restaurant given the name implies a specialized dining experience with a specific cuisine. Therefore, 'Full Service Restaurants' is the more appropriate category.",,"This U.S. industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing food services to patrons who order and are served while seated (i.e., waiter/waitress service) and pay after eating.
