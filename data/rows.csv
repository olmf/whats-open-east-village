A limited service restaurant, on the other hand, is one where customers order and pay at a counter and might receive minimal table service. Since the specific service style of The Nook is not provided, it cannot be definitively placed into either full service or limited service categories. However, given the usual sit-down nature of Korean restaurants that might include table grilling or specific dining experiences, it is more likely to be a full service restaurant.
