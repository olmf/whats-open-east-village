A limited service restaurant, on the other hand, is one where customers order and pay at a counter and might receive minimal table service.

Given this information, I must select one of these two categories. Since no distinction between full service and limited service dining is specified, and considering many Chinese restaurants might offer dine-in service, 'Full Service Restaurants' is a logical assumption. However, given general trends towards simplified service or express dining in this type of cuisine, 'Limited Service Restaurants' might actually be more fitting for smaller or takeaway-focused eateries, which might make this assumption more accurate.
