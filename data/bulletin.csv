"Join The Fight To Save Our Storefronts","> These bills call on commercial tenants, landlords and the state to **share the burden** of the rent crisis.  Our shared-burden model envisions a solution in which negatively-impacted commercial tenants can obtain a proportional amount of rent forgiveness from landlords, and landlords can then obtain a proportional amount of reimbursement from the state, beginning retroactively to March 7 and continuing for 180 days after the lifting of the emergency order. We strongly feel this model is the best way to get through this crisis intact, together.
